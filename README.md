# What's this?

Simple, this is a simple and portable tool to export png files into vtf with the spritecard capability for your particles, just drag any kind of sprite sheet image (You can find it from many games)
Select the columns and rows, and then export it to the destination you wish

You might need a source game with mksheet, I have been using Counter-Strike: Source as Garry's Mod doesn't ship with it

Example you can play with:
![T_UI_Fire_Aura](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83880d81-e2e3-4f54-9e37-98b92789e543)
![T_UI_StoryDemo_BloodSplatter](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1cdd3ea-b4b6-4407-b0d2-3241effb2f49)

# Compability

As far I can see, it works fine with Counter-Strike: Source, not really sure why, but SDK 2010 doesn't work well, so I recommend you in case it doesn't work, just get CSS and use it mksheet.exe

Please feel free to ask your questions and/or contribuite with this software
